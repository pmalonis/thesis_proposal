background and significance

motor cortex is tuned to kinematics, kinetics, and sensory variables,
but we still don't know what functional role it plays in producing movements.

mouse model
-contains cortico
-motor cortex necessary for producing some but not all movements, most needed for dexterous movements
-low threshold current, mediated by corticospinal tract
-premotor areas homologous
-genetic lines enable easy imaging and viruses optigenetics


stroke bmi

flexibility is fundamental to motor cortex. to get at function one must look at activity
over time over many behaviors to observe this flexibility in action.
examples of flexibility:
	 motor maps are flexible
	 map of new arm emerges in bmi (nicoleis?)
	 drastic changes in synaptic connectivity, underlies learning
	 kawai 2015
to get at this function one must get at behavioral repetoire

problem:
	sadtler et al. 2014 constraints on learning.

freely behaviing imaging enables flexibility
